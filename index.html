<!-- You should use it to organize all of the other tags for the Web Page -->

<html>
  <!-- <head> tag -->
  <!-- All the not-visible content of the web page should be contained on the <head> tag -->
  <!-- You can use this tag to load scripts like CSS and Javascript -->
  <head>
    <title>HTML basics</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  </head>

  <!-- <link> tag -->
  <!-- Allows you to reference other files that work together with this file-->

  <!-- The type attribute set to text/css lets the browser know you are loading a CSS file -->
  <!-- The rel attribute is short for relationship-->
  <!-- The CSS selectors and rules are contained in the CSS file -->

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css" />

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.
